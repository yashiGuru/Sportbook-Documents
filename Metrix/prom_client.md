# Prometheus Monitoring with `prom-client` in a Sportsbook API

## **Introduction**
`prom-client` is a Node.js library that helps in collecting and exposing application metrics for **Prometheus**, an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit. This is essential for **sportsbook applications**, which handle high transaction volumes, real-time bets, and require consistent performance monitoring.

---

## **Why Use `prom-client` in a Sportsbook Project?**

1️⃣ **Track API Performance & Load**  
   - Monitor API response times and ensure your platform handles peak betting periods.
   - Example: Track `/placebet` and `/withdraw` latency.

2️⃣ **Monitor Betting Transactions**  
   - Count the number of **successful vs. failed bets**.
   - Example metric:
   ```
   betting_transactions_total{status="success"} 1200
   betting_transactions_total{status="failed"} 30
   ```

3️⃣ **Detect High Latency Issues**  
   - Track how long **bet settlements** and **withdrawals** take.
   - Example:
   ```
   bet_settlement_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.5"} 120
   bet_settlement_duration_seconds_bucket{le="1.0"} 80
   ```

4️⃣ **Monitor Server Resource Usage**  
   - Keep track of **CPU, memory, and active users**.
   - Example:
   ```
   process_memory_rss_bytes 97845248
   nodejs_active_handles_total 78
   ```

5️⃣ **Alerting & Auto-Scaling**  
   - Use **Prometheus + Grafana** to set up alerts if:
     - API response time **> 2 seconds**.
     - Betting failures exceed **10%**.
     - Server CPU usage is **> 80%**.

---

## **When Do You Need This?**
- If your sportsbook handles **high traffic and real-time betting**, monitoring API latency and transaction success rates is essential.
- If you want **to prevent downtime** by setting up alerts for system failures.
- If you need **detailed system insights** into memory, CPU, and response times.

## **How to Implement in Your Sportsbook API**

### **1. Install `prom-client`**
```bash
npm install prom-client
```

### **2. Create a Metrics File (`metrics.js`)**
```javascript
import client from "prom-client";

const register = new client.Registry();
client.collectDefaultMetrics({ register });

export const betCounter = new client.Counter({
  name: "betting_transactions_total",
  help: "Total number of bets placed",
  labelNames: ["status"],
});

export const apiLatency = new client.Histogram({
  name: "api_response_time_seconds",
  help: "API response time",
  labelNames: ["route", "method"],
  buckets: [0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5],
});

register.registerMetric(betCounter);
register.registerMetric(apiLatency);
export { register };
```

### **3. Use in Express Middleware (`server.js`)**
```javascript
import express from "express";
import { register, betCounter, apiLatency } from "./metrics.js";

const app = express();

app.get("/metrics", async (req, res) => {
  res.set("Content-Type", register.contentType);
  res.end(await register.metrics());
});

app.post("/placebet", (req, res) => {
  const end = apiLatency.startTimer({ route: "/placebet", method: "POST" });

  try {
    betCounter.inc({ status: "success" });
    res.json({ message: "Bet placed successfully!" });
  } catch (error) {
    betCounter.inc({ status: "failed" });
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Bet placement failed" });
  } finally {
    end();
  }
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server running on port 3000"));
```

## **Any Side Effects? Will It Slow Down the System?**
🚀 **No major impact!** `prom-client` runs in the background and does not interfere with critical operations. However, to avoid performance issues:
- Use **sampling** (record metrics at intervals, not every request).
- Optimize **Prometheus scraping intervals** (e.g., every 10s instead of every 1s).
- Avoid excessive custom metrics that may overload memory.

---

## **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**

### **1. What is the `/metrics` endpoint used for?**
It exposes all application metrics in **Prometheus format**, which Prometheus scrapes for monitoring.

### **2. Do I need `prom-client` if I already have logs?**
Yes! Logs help diagnose issues **after** they happen, while Prometheus **alerts you in real-time** before issues impact users.

### **3. Can I integrate it with Grafana?**
Yes! Grafana can visualize Prometheus metrics with **dashboards** for real-time tracking.

### **4. How does it help in scaling?**
You can configure **auto-scaling** based on traffic spikes by monitoring request rates and CPU usage.

### **5. Is it production-ready?**
Absolutely! It is widely used in **high-scale applications** including betting platforms, e-commerce, and cloud services.

## **Final Thoughts: Do You Need `prom-client`?**
✅ **Yes, if you want:**
- **Real-time API performance tracking**.
- **Betting transaction monitoring** (success vs. failure).
- **System health monitoring** (CPU, memory, active users).
- **Alerts for issues before they impact users**.

🚀 **If your sportsbook is handling high traffic, live bets, and real-time settlements, `prom-client` is a must-have!**

### **Next Steps**
- Connect Prometheus to your **Grafana dashboard**.
- Configure **alerts** for response time & failed transactions.
- Fine-tune **metrics collection intervals** to optimize performance.
