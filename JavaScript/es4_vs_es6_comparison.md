## Introduction

React.js leverages modern JavaScript (ES6 and later) to build efficient, scalable web applications. This guide explains why ES6 is preferred over the never-standardized ES4 in React development.

---

## What is ES4?

- **Abandoned Attempt:** ES4 was an early proposal to enhance JavaScript but was never standardized.
- **Proposed Features:** Included optional type annotations, classes, and namespaces.
- **Modern Relevance:** No modern JavaScript or React project uses ES4.

**Conclusion:** ES4 is irrelevant for React.js development.

## What is ES6? (Used in React)

ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced many features that simplify and improve React development. Here are some key features:

### 1. Arrow Functions (=>)

**Before (ES5):**

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name;
}

After (ES6):

const greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name}`;
Benefit:
Shorter syntax with an implicit return.
```

### 2. let and const for Variables
let: Mutable (can change)
const: Immutable (cannot be reassigned)

const name = "John"; // Can't be reassigned
let age = 25;        // Can be changed
Benefit:
Prevents accidental reassignments.

### 3. Template Literals (``)

const message = `Hello, ${name}!`;
Benefit:
Cleaner and more readable string handling.

### 4. Destructuring

const user = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
const { name, age } = user;
console.log(name, age); // Alice, 30
Benefit:
Less code and improved readability.

### 5. Spread and Rest Operators (...)
Spread Operator:

const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [...arr1, 4, 5]; // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Rest Operator:


const sum = (a, b, ...nums) => console.log(nums);
sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5); // [3, 4, 5]
Benefit:
Simplifies handling of arrays and objects.

### 6. Classes & Inheritance

class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  greet() {
    return `Hello, ${this.name}`;
  }
}

const user = new Person("John");
console.log(user.greet()); // Hello, John
Benefit:
Enables object-oriented programming in JavaScript.

### 7. Modules (import / export)
Exporting (utils.js):


export const add = (a, b) => a + b;
Importing (app.js):


import { add } from "./utils";
console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
Benefit:
Makes React code modular and reusable.

### 8. Promises & Async/Await (For API Calls)
Using Promises:


fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));
Using Async/Await:


const fetchData = async () => {
  const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
};
Benefit:
Provides cleaner, more readable asynchronous code.

Conclusion
ES4 ❌: Never officially adopted and irrelevant for modern React development.
ES6 ✅: Introduced key features like arrow functions, classes, destructuring, and async/await that make React development easier and more efficient.
